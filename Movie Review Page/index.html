            ü¶Å Mahavatar Narsimha (2025) is a mythological animated epic that brings
            to life the fierce avatar of Lord Vishnu‚ÄîNarsimha, the half-man,
            half-lion incarnation. Directed by Ashwin Kumar, the film follows the
            timeless tale of Prahlad, a young devotee of Vishnu, who stands firm in
            his faith despite the wrath of his tyrant father, Hiranyakashipu. When
            evil threatens to overpower devotion, Vishnu manifests as Narsimha to
            restore cosmic balance.
