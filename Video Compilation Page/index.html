            <h2>HTML
            </h2>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, forms the backbone of web pages by defining their basic structure and
                layout. It uses a series of elements to display text, images, lists, tables, and other static content on
                a web page.

                CSS
            </h2>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to control the visual presentation of HTML elements on a web
                page. It allows for customized styling, including colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing, making websites
                visually appealing. CSS also supports responsive design, ensuring web pages look good on all devices.

            <h2>JavaScript
            </h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to static web pages, enabling dynamic
                content updates, form validations, animations, and responsive behaviors based on user interactions and
                events.
